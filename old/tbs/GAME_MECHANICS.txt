turn based
capacitor is energy reserve
firing weapons and moving use reserved energy
each turn your capacitor charges an amount based on ???ship stat/equip modules???
turn order is dependent on ?agility?
turn starts at zero inf cycle increment +1
when turn reaches your ?agility? you can action (move and fire)

example:
you ?agility? = 15
enemy1 ?agility? = 16
enemy2 ?agility? = 20
turn  |   1   |     2   |   3   |  4   |   5   |
you   |15     |30       | 45    | 60   | 75    |
enem1 | 16    |  32     |    48 |    64|   80  |
enem2 |     20|       40|       | 60   |   80  |  (100)

enem2 only actions 4 times while you and enem1 action 5 times
when tied person with lowest(highest? 100?-agility?) ?agility? goes first
if two persons have same ?agility? --- ???higher energy???

weapon examples: (dont know about accuracy or crits. not fond of acc [hate missing])
proto dart V -
dmg: 15
range: 3
cap cost: 5
target: single
low cost low power single target short range. used for cheap small suppresion/quick kills on low healths

accelerated missile -
dmg: 40
range: 5
cap cost: 20
target: single
mod/high power mod range single target. slightly range/pow over standard missile at cost of cap

mirv -
dmg: ??
range: 6
cap cost: 30
target: multiple/spread??
multiple possiblities for different AOE missiles:
 vvv
vvcvv
vcXcv <-- diminishing dmg spread in confined area
vvcvv
 vvv

X X X X <-- multiple spaced targets fixed based off of pointed target

X   X
       X <-- multi target lock
  X

weight? EDIT: probably make weight stat into speed/mov stat. just have modules -speed/mov instead of wgt
ships have base weight. modules have weights. weight determines cap use for movement.
lightweight modules will generally have less output (dmg/range for weapons. effects amoutns for supports)
heavy modules be sturdier/heat resistant allow high outputs but at cost of weight/movement

other possible modules:
supports (+cap +recharge +weapon output[dmg and/or range possibly add targets, crit] +armor +sheild etc)
sniper/long range high pow high cap cost
AOEs as discussed
wide variety of single shots for in-depth team building
LAZARZ (Dot??? at cost of cap/cycle [not turn! it would con drain until you turn it off during a turn]
energy syphons (DoT as well? single bursts? both?)
machine gonorrhea (needs bullets to fire. different bullet types for sheild/armor penetration etc)
nukes??? dmg all units on the feild friendly and foe EQUALLY! turn countdown after fire? charge before??
EMPs dmg sheilds only but very efficient
futuristic weaponry - fission warheads (just a fancy name), [drawing a blank im sure you have neat ideas]

deployables:
MINES - TEEEMMOOOOOOOOO
turrets - herpaderpaderp
blockades thingies - must move around them or kill [lim amount per person?per team? cant get ridiculous.]
tesla coils :::
---deployable: limited duration (x cycles) causes increased cap regen to adjacent units FRIEND/FOE alike
---on battlefield maps: permanent at team spawn points. much much much higher regen than deployables.

SHEILDS HOW DID I FORGET:
equip proper sheild and support modules to determine sheild health and recharge rate.
higher recharge rate = more cap drain per turn. less = less. derp.

quests:
new tab next to cargo/ship/research/[quests]?
generic !/? above heads
to keep things simple and easy on server maybe only one quest at a time? have to drop to get another?
or even do FF:T style (sort of) no random monsters, get xp by doing these "quests" that
 put you into a battle... which leads to next thought ---> parties

party:
party leader will control quest activity (based off FF:T style idea)
party members will be supporting persons on your team. no friendly AI.
when leader accepts quest, all party members will be asked to enter battle.
all recieve equal reward from quest, but FF:T xp gain during battle? (based on lvs and dmg output +kills)
repeatble quests for crappy noobs who fail at everything in life and should eat poop brownies.

AI:
programmed based on roles.
support/tank/short range/long range/etc
aggroed to appropiate effective roles/nearby low healths.
or just easy peasy kill closest guy b.s. whatever works.
